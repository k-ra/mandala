# Mandala

Hello and welcome to the software input interface to a real-life drawing machine!
Mandala records a user's one single stroke and uploads it onto a realtime database. Then, a drawing machine (two axes of stepper motors) scrawls your defined brushstroke back and forth on a rotating table. After a full revolution, you have a custom mandala from your unique brushstroke, in real time!
